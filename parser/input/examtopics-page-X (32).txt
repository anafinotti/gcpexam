Pergunta:
Your digital media company stores a large number of video files on-premises. Each video file ranges from 100 MB to 100 GB. You are currently storing 150 TB of video data in your on-premises network, with no room for expansion. You need to migrate all infrequently accessed video files older than one year to Cloud Storage to ensure that on-premises storage remains available for new files. You must also minimize costs and control bandwidth usage. What should you do?

Alternativas:
- A. Use Storage Transfer Service to move the data from the selected on-premises file storage systems to a Cloud Storage bucket.
- B. Use Transfer Appliance to request an appliance. Load the data locally, and ship the appliance back to Google for ingestion into Cloud Storage.
- C. Set up a Cloud Interconnect connection between the on-premises network and Google Cloud. Establish a private endpoint for Filestore access. Transfer the data from the existing Network File System (NFS) to Filestore.
- D. Create a Cloud Storage bucket. Establish an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with write permissions to the bucket. Use the gsutil tool to directly copy files over the network to Cloud Storage.

Resposta correta:
A. Use Storage Transfer Service to move the data from the selected on-premises file storage systems to a Cloud Storage bucket.

Actually the question does not provide information about the size of data to be transferred, so it is not possible to make a choice between A and B. I choose B as since even 20% of overall basket justifies Transfer Appliance

Choose Transfer Appliance for large on-premises data transfers (over 10 TB)

Selected Answer: A
The most accurate answer is [A] since Storage Transfer Service allow you to control the bandwidth.
Storage options:
1. Data Size < 1TB ==> gcloud storage
2. Data Size > 1 TB And enough bandwidth ==> STS
3. Data Size > 1TB and between buckets in GCP ==> STS
From other Cloud Providers => STS
The only recommended way to use the storage appliance when (Date Size > 1TB) and (Not enough bandwidth to meet your project deadline)

150 TB is very large — transferring that amount of data over the internet (even with Storage Transfer Service or gsutil) would take weeks and use a lot of bandwidth

Storage Transfer Service is a managed service designed specifically for use cases like this (large-scale online data migration). It automatically manages data transfers from on-premises file systems or other cloud storage to Cloud Storage, including scheduling, bandwidth throttling, and retry handling.
