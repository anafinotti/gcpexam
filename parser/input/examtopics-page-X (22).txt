Pergunta:
Your company is using Google Workspace to manage employee accounts. Anticipated growth will increase the number of personnel from 100 employees to 1,000 employees within 2 years. Most employees will need access to your company’s Google Cloud account. The systems and processes will need to support 10x growth without performance degradation, unnecessary complexity, or security issues. What should you do?

Alternativas:
- A. Migrate the users to Active Directory. Connect the Human Resources system to Active Directory. Turn on Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS) for Cloud Identity. Turn on Identity Federation from Cloud Identity to Active Directory.
- B. Organize the users in Cloud Identity into groups. Enforce multi-factor authentication in Cloud Identity.
- C. Turn on identity federation between Cloud Identity and Google Workspace. Enforce multi-factor authentication for domain wide delegation.
- D. Use a third-party identity provider service through federation. Synchronize the users from Google Workplace to the third-party provider in real time.

Resposta correta:
B. Organize the users in Cloud Identity into groups. Enforce multi-factor authentication in Cloud Identity.

Selected Answer: C
B is incorrect because organizing user accounts within Cloud Identity and enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) alone is a limited approach for handling large-scale growth. While Cloud Identity groups and MFA are important for managing user permissions and enhancing security, this option lacks a robust identity management solution to handle the projected tenfold user increase. It does not address scalability challenges or provide a way to efficiently manage identities across Google Cloud and other services the company might integrate as they expand. While it would add some security, it would not streamline identity management or account synchronization at the scale needed.

I see everyone is split here, but I like C best. Option C provides a streamlined and secure way to accommodate growth within the Google ecosystem. It prioritizes both ease of management and security.
You already use Workspace for user management... Adding Active Directory adds complexity and is unnecessary; A is out. While improving security and organization, it doesn't directly solve the issue of seamless access to GCP resources or address user management as you scale; B is out…. While some scenarios might justify it, you're already using Google Workspace for identity. This option adds complexity, cost, and an extra system to manage; D is out….

C is eliminated because you cannot update or modify an existing instance template. It is immutable.

D is eliminated because you cannot delete an instance template if a managed instance group references it.

B is eliminated because you cannot set different/custom name for persistent disk in an instance template.

When a managed instance group raises an alert indicating that new instance creation has failed, it's important to investigate the issue. This issue is typically related to the configuration of the instance template used by the group. Therefore, the first step is to verify that the instance template being utilized by the instance group contains valid syntax. This includes checking all settings such as machine type, boot disk, and any custom configurations. Valid syntax ensures that the instances created adhere to the specified configurations.

Artifact Registry is a fully managed container registry that integrates seamlessly with Google Kubernetes Engine and other Google Cloud services. By uploading the Docker image to Artifact Registry, you can create a Kubernetes Deployment that references the image stored in Artifact Registry. This ensures that Kubernetes can pull the image from a trusted and managed source, while the Deployment manages the deployment and scaling of the application pods based on the image.
