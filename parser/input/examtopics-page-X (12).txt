Page X — Question #121

Pergunta:
Your managed instance group raised an alert stating that new instance creation has failed to create new instances. You need to maintain the number of running instances specified by the template to be able to process expected application traffic. What should you do?

Alternativas:
- A. Create an instance template that contains valid syntax which will be used by the instance group. Delete any persistent disks with the same name as instance names.
- B. Create an instance template that contains valid syntax that will be used by the instance group. Verify that the instance name and persistent disk name values are not the same in the template.
- C. Verify that the instance template being used by the instance group contains valid syntax. Delete any persistent disks with the same name as instance names. Set the disks.autoDelete property to true in the instance template.
- D. Delete the current instance template and replace it with a new instance template. Verify that the instance name and persistent disk name values are not the same in the template. Set the disks.autoDelete property to true in the instance template.

Resposta correta:
A. Create an instance template that contains valid syntax which will be used by the instance group. Delete any persistent disks with the same name as instance names.

Really tricky question.
Ideal scenario would be
1. create new template, while creating ensure that in the new template disks.autoDelete=true, 3. delete existing persistent disks, 4. make rolling update ...
In order to switch to new template we need "Rolling update". Unfortunately, it is not mentioned.
With current options
C - not correct, we cannot update existing template
D - not correct, we cannot delete existing template when it is in use (just checked in GCP) (We need rolling update)
B - will not solve our problem without Rolling update
A - This is the only option (I know that it can be temporary) that will work without Rolling update according to

Correct Answer is (C):
Your instance template has set the disks.autoDelete option to false for boot persistent disks so that when a VM has been deleted (for example, because of autohealing), the persistent disk was not deleted. When the managed instance group attempted to recreate the VM with the same name, it ran into the same issue where a persistent disk already exists with the same name. Delete the existing persistent disk to resolve the immediate problem and update the instance template to set the disks.autoDelete to true if you would like boot persistent disks to be deleted alongside the instance

Why the other options are less ideal:

C: While it includes autoDelete, it doesn’t mention updating the template or verifying name uniqueness, which is necessary to resolve the issue.

Instance creation can fail if there are naming conflicts between instance names and persistent disk names, or if disks are not set to auto-delete and already exist. Verifying the template, deleting conflicting disks, and ensuring disks.autoDelete is set to true will help maintain the correct number of running instances as specified by the template.

From my understanding this VM creation issue is based on boot disk from a previous failed VM exists within the MIG making the MIG unable to create a New VM for that failed VM (Auto healing). all the answers are based on this solution. (There might be other issues as per below document which needs other solutions).
But the document states below for boot disk issue scenario in a MIG,
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-migs
"The boot disk already exists
By default, a new boot persistent disk is created when you create an instance. The name of the boot disk matches the name of the VM. If you name a VM my-instance, the disk is also named my-instance. If a persistent disk already exists with that name, the request fails. To resolve this issue, you can optionally take a snapshot, and then delete the existing persistent disk."

By setting up a Cloud Monitoring Alerting Policy and configuring the notification channel to an email address, you can receive email alerts when the CPU usage exceeds the threshold that you set. This can be done by using Google Cloud's built-in monitoring and alerting features, which can be more reliable and easier to manage than setting up a custom script or using external email services.

Without knowing that much, you can discard easily B,C as they don't make any sense. Automation should be a key in this answer. Also you should discard "A" as with a CronJob you won't spann on time as it will be a fixed time checking. So the only one that is left is D, as just creating an alert and sending it to "something else" (in this case a webhook) in an automated way, should be the common sense way of handling this.

Since the Apache server is not the only application in the project, a project- or billing-account-wide budget alert would not be specific to the server. Exporting billing data to BigQuery allows you to filter and sum egress costs specifically for the Compute Engine instance running Apache. Automating this with a Cloud Function and Cloud Scheduler ensures you get notified when the threshold is exceeded.

Selected Answer: C
The SSL Proxy Load Balancer is designed to handle SSL-encrypted TCP traffic (such as on port 443) and provides global load balancing with Google’s worldwide edge network. It minimizes latency by terminating SSL connections at the edge closest to the client and then forwarding traffic to your backend instances. The HTTPS Load Balancer is for HTTP/HTTPS (Layer 7) traffic, while the SSL Proxy Load Balancer is for SSL/TLS over TCP (Layer 4) traffic.

SSL Proxy Load Balancer is specifically for SSL-encrypted TCP traffic. As for port 443 it is clearly stated in question, that application "receives SSL-encrypted TCP traffic on port 443", not HTTP(S) traffic. So we can use 443 port for TCP traffic (tcp:443). https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl/setting-up-ssl#proxy-protocol

As per the GCP document below,
"Proxy Network Load Balancers are intended for TCP traffic only, with or without SSL. For HTTP(S) traffic, we recommend that you use an Application Load Balancer instead."
https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/proxy-network-load-balancer
hence even if both A and C are capable to carter for this requirement, the Google recommendation is A. As per my understanding both A and C can divert client to closest backend service reducing the latency.
Also in 2024, can refer to below as well.
"HTTP/3 on your load balancer can improve web page load times, reduce video rebuffering, and improve throughput on higher latency connections."

You have an application on a general-purpose Compute Engine instance that is experiencing excessive disk read throttling on its Zonal SSD Persistent Disk. The application primarily reads large files from disk. The disk size is currently 350 GB. You want to provide the maximum amount of throughput while minimizing costs.
What should you do?

Alternativas:
- A. Increase the size of the disk to 1 TB.
- B. Increase the allocated CPU to the instance.
- C. Migrate to use a Local SSD on the instance.
- D. Migrate to use a Regional SSD on the instance.

I once thought that A was the correct response because of the persistence problem, but reading the question carefully, we must choose C over A.
The question does not stipulate that the local files must be persistent, and this is the only reason why you would choose "A" over "C".
Also, the question has an important key word: Minimising costs.
1TB of zonal persistent disk costs a huge amount more than 350GB of local disk.
We should choose C.

Agree. This is also cheaper than having 350 Gb persistent SSD:
Here are calculations (taken from GCP when creating instance)
350 Gb SSD Persistent disk: 59.50$/month, read IOPS: 10 500 with n1-standard-1
1000 Gb SSD Persistent disk: 170.00$/month, read IOPS: 15 000 with n1-standard-1

2. Anonymous: ESP_SAP Highly Voted  4 years, 5 months ago
Correct Answer is (C):
Performance
Standard persistent disks are efficient and economical for handling sequential read/write operations, but they aren't optimized to handle high rates of random input/output operations per second (IOPS). If your apps require high rates of random IOPS, use SSD persistent disks. SSD persistent disks are designed for single-digit millisecond latencies. Observed latency is application specific.

Selected Answer: A
Zonal SSD Persistent Disks in Google Cloud scale read and write throughput linearly with disk size.
At 350 GB, your disk has limited throughput. By increasing the size to 1 TB, you significantly increase the read IOPS and throughput, which helps reduce disk read throttling.
This approach is cost-effective because:
You stay within the same disk type (Zonal SSD).
You avoid the higher cost of Local SSDs or Regional SSDs unless absolutely necessary.

Selected Answer: A
On Google Cloud, the throughput and IOPS of a Zonal SSD Persistent Disk scale with the disk size. By increasing the disk size (e.g., to 1 TB), you increase the available throughput and IOPS, which will help reduce disk read throttling. This is a cost-effective solution compared to using Local SSDs (which are more expensive and ephemeral) or Regional SSDs (which are for high availability, not performance). Increasing CPU does not affect disk throughput.

Correct A. A Local SSD is generally more expensive than a Zonal SSD Persistent Disk. And The ephemeral nature of Local SSDs can lead to additional costs for data replication or backups. So C is a good option for high throughput, but in terms of achieving increased throughput for the least amount of cost, A is the better option.

C. Migrate to use a Local SSD on the instance.
Local SSDs provide high-throughput, low-latency storage that is physically attached to the instance. This can be beneficial for applications experiencing excessive disk read throttling, especially when dealing with large files. Local SSDs are ideal for temporary data that can be recomputed or regenerated if lost, and they can offer improved performance compared to Zonal SSD Persistent Disks.

C. Migrate to use a Local SSD on the instance. Local SSDs provide higher throughput and lower latency compared to Zonal SSD Persistent Disks, and are optimized for use cases that require high-speed, temporary storage. They are physically attached to the instance, so network latencies are minimized. However, they are not intended for long-term storage and may not provide the same level of durability as persistent disks. Since the application is primarily reading large files from disk and experiencing disk read throttling, using a Local SSD should provide a significant improvement in performance while minimizing costs. Increasing the size of the Zonal SSD Persistent Disk or increasing the allocated CPU to the instance may provide some improvement, but are unlikely to fully address the disk read throttling issue. Migrating to a Regional SSD is also not likely to improve performance significantly, as the disk is still separate from the instance and network latencies can impact performance.

According to the page containing the tables and to the tables "https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance#n1_vms" and "https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance#n2_vms", the number of CPU cores greatly influence the available max. read THROUGHPUT ("excessive disk read throttling on its Zonal SSD Persistent Disk", "The application primarily reads large files from disk.") on general purpose VMs.
The question also requires minimizing the costs, however, as Local SSDs are EPHEMERAL, they are out of question for the scenario at hand.
So, answer "B" seems to be the correct one.

I think, you can't expand ip range subnet, if there isn't space in VPC. I read this question a lot, VPC CIDR like with 172.16.20.128/25 and there's only one subnet 172.16.20.128/25 inside this VPC, so you can't expand nothing. for me, there's Letter C and D works, but letter D is necessary extra work.

VPC's DO NOT have IP range limitations.
You can only object if 172.16.20.0/25 is in use in the same VPC or in a VPC that this VPC is already peered with.
.128/25 expands to .0/24 (i.e. "backwards") So as long as it's free, you're good.
In a question like this, it's obvious that the simple answer is the right one, i.e. A - Expansion.

I think they meant to say there are no remaining private IP addresses left to assign to new virtual machine (VM) instances within the specified subnet of the VPC network.
it is impossible to suggest that they run out of the class B private IP range because, in the Class B private IP address range, there are approximately 65,534 IP addresses.

When applied to a dataset, this role provides permissions to:
Read the dataset's metadata and list tables in the dataset.
Read data and metadata from the dataset's tables.
When applied at the project or organization level, this role can also enumerate all datasets in the project. Additional roles, however, are necessary to allow the running of jobs.

Selected Answer: B
Why B is Correct
The application will run its query jobs in your project (Project-A), so it needs the bigquery.jobs.create permission there (which is typically included in BigQuery Job User).
However, that job needs permission to read the data from the other project (Project-B). The BigQuery Data Viewer (roles/bigquery.dataViewer) role provides exactly this permission (bigquery.tables.getData) and is the role with the least privilege for this task.
Therefore, you must ask the other team to add your service account as a principal in their project and grant it the BigQuery Data Viewer role on their dataset or project.
Why A is not correct:
The BigQuery Job User role is needed to run jobs. Since your application runs the job in its own project, it doesn't need that permission on the other team's project.
