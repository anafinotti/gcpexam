Selected Answer: D
Cloud Billing export to BigQuery enables you to export detailed Google Cloud billing data (such as usage, cost estimates, and pricing data) automatically throughout the day to a BigQuery dataset that you specify. Then you can access your Cloud Billing data from BigQuery for detailed analysis, or use a tool like Looker Studio to visualize your data.

Selected Answer: D
Option D closely aligns with the requirements mentioned in the question.
By configuring Cloud Billing data export to BigQuery, you can automate the process of exporting billing data to a BigQuery dataset. You can then use Looker Studio, a data visualization and exploration platform, to create a dashboard on top of the BigQuery export. This allows you to visualize costs with specific metrics that can be dynamically calculated based on company-specific criteria.

Pergunta:
You have an application that runs on Compute Engine VM instances in a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Your company’s security policies only allow the use of internal IP addresses on VM instances and do not let VM instances connect to the internet. You need to ensure that the application can access a file hosted in a Cloud Storage bucket within your project. What should you do?

Alternativas:
- A. Enable Private Service Access on the Cloud Storage Bucket.
- B. Add storage.googleapis.com to the list of restricted services in a VPC Service Controls perimeter and add your project to the list of protected projects.
- C. Enable Private Google Access on the subnet within the custom VPC.

Cloud Storage is not a supported service for Private Service Access. Hence, A cannot be the answer.

VM instances that only have internal IP addresses (no external IP addresses) can use Private Google Access. They can reach the external IP addresses of Google APIs and services. If you disable Private Google Access, the VM instances can no longer reach Google APIs and services; they can only send traffic within the VPC network.

Pergunta:
Your company completed the acquisition of a startup and is now merging the IT systems of both companies. The startup had a production Google Cloud project in their organization. You need to move this project into your organization and ensure that the project is billed to your organization. You want to accomplish this task with minimal effort. What should you do?

Alternativas:
- A. Use the projects.move method to move the project to your organization. Update the billing account of the project to that of your organization.
- B. Ensure that you have an Organization Administrator Identity and Access Management (IAM) role assigned to you in both organizations. Navigate to the Resource Manager in the startup’s Google Cloud organization, and drag the project to your company's organization.
- C. Create a Private Catalog for the Google Cloud Marketplace, and upload the resources of the startup's production project to the Catalog. Share the Catalog with your organization, and deploy the resources in your company’s project.
- D. Create an infrastructure-as-code template for all resources in the project by using Terraform, and deploy that template to a new project in your organization. Delete the project from the startup’s Google Cloud organization.

Option A is correct as it suggests using the "projects.move" method provided by Google Cloud to move the project from the startup's organization to your organization. This method allows you to transfer the ownership and control of a project to another organization. By moving the project, you can ensure that it is under your organization's management.
While the other options contain elements that may be relevant in certain scenarios, they do not directly address the requirement of moving the project and ensuring billing to your organization.

The new command is much easier
gcloud beta projects move PROJECT_ID --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID or --folder=FOLDER_ID

Option A suggests creating one CNAME record to point mydomain.com to the load balancer, which is incorrect because CNAME records cannot coexist with other record types on the same domain/subdomain. In this case, you need to use an A record instead.
Option B suggests creating two AAAA records, which are used for IPv6 addresses. Unless you specifically have an IPv6 address for your load balancer, using AAAA records would not be appropriate.
Option D suggests creating two NS records, which are used for specifying the authoritative name servers for a domain. NS records are not used to point subdomains to IP addresses or load balancers.
Therefore, option C is the correct answer, as it correctly suggests creating one A record to point mydomain.com to the load balancer, and two CNAME records to point WWW and HOME to mydomain.com respectively.

Network tags can be simpler to manage, especially if the access control is based on broader categories (like application servers and database servers) rather than individual instances.
If you need fine-grained control and identity-based access, go with service accounts. If you prefer simplicity and broader categorization, network tags may be a suitable choice.

Although what was previously stated is correct, I must correct it. The correct answer would be option A. Creating an ingress firewall rule on the subnet where your database servers are located is the appropriate approach. This rule would control incoming traffic to the database servers, ensuring that only traffic from the specified application servers (identified by network tags or service accounts) is allowed.

Option A is the better answer for the given scenario. It allows you to centralize billing and payment management while providing flexibility to project creators. By creating a billing account and associating a payment method with it, you establish a central source for billing and payment for all projects.
Granting project creators permission to associate the billing account with their projects ensures that they can create projects without the need for their individual credit card information. This approach streamlines the process and avoids the hassle of collecting credit card details from each engineer.
Additionally, this option allows for easy monitoring and management of project costs through a single billing account, making it simpler to track expenses and allocate resources effectively.

Pergunta:
Your team is using Linux instances on Google Cloud. You need to ensure that your team logs in to these instances in the most secure and cost efficient way. What should you do?

Alternativas:
- A. Attach a public IP to the instances and allow incoming connections from the internet on port 22 for SSH.
- B. Use the gcloud compute ssh command with the --tunnel-through-iap flag. Allow ingress traffic from the IP range 35.235.240.0/20 on port 22.
- C. Use a third party tool to provide remote access to the instances.
- D. Create a bastion host with public internet access. Create the SSH tunnel to the instance through the bastion host.

Resposta correta:
B. Use the gcloud compute ssh command with the --tunnel-through-iap flag. Allow ingress traffic from the IP range 35.235.240.0/20 on port 22.

According to Gemini: In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) is a more secure alternative to bastion hosts for accessing private resources. IAP encrypts SSH connections end-to-end, so it can't inspect the contents of the session. IAP also provides access controls to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/connect/ssh-best-practices/network-access#use-a-bastion-host

Why the others are not correct?
Bastion Host: While a bastion host can provide remote access, it introduces additional complexity and potential security risks.
Third-Party Tools: Using third-party tools may add costs and introduce dependencies.

You can use Bastion if
"You have a specific use case, like session recording, and you can't use IAP."

Thanks for that link but I think it is C, Although totally agree that Bastion comes 2nd in that table, no way all the user would have IP within this range 35.235.240.0/20!

"allows ingress traffic from the IP range `35.235.240.0/20`. This range contains all IP addresses that IAP uses for TCP forwarding"

But the question states "You need to ensure that your team logs in to these instances in the most secure and cost efficient way"
Bastion is more secure than IAP but I'm not sure is more cost effective...
Hard to choose

Understood about IAP being a secure way to SSH but where did the "Allow ingress traffic from the IP range 35.235.240.0/20 on port 22." come from and how does that fit in? The question had no details about it and the IP range seemed to come out of nowhere.

35.235.240.0/20 is IP range of Cloud IAP for TCP forwarding, we need to allow ingress as the guideline below:
