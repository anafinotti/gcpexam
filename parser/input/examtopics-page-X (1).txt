Selected Answer: A
The correct answer is Option A - Deployment Manager. Deployment Manager is a configuration management tool that allows you to define and deploy a set of resources, including Compute Engine VMs, in a declarative manner. You can use it to specify the exact specifications of your VMs in a configuration file, and Deployment Manager will create and manage those VMs for you. Deployment Manager is recommended by Google as a way to automate and manage the deployment of resources on the Google Cloud Platform.

The question says - "Dynamic way of provision VMs on Compute Engine" which both the Managed Instance group and the Deployment Manager does, but for different purposes. So here the answer can be more of Deployment Manager as it covers the scope of question, while the Managed Instance group can also dynamically provision VMs based on configuration file but only for auto-healing or horizontal scaling purposes, the answer could have been C if the question was asked as "Dynamic way of provision VMs on Compute Engine for horizontal scaling/auto healing"

A. As its google recommended best practice - although will be deprecated December 2025 and you will need to use Infrastructure manager instead. You specify a dedicated configuration yaml file.

Selected Answer: C
The correct answer is Option C. To deploy a Docker container on Kubernetes Engine, you should first create a Docker image from the Dockerfile and push it to Container Registry, which is a fully-managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for you to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. Then, you can create a Deployment YAML file that specifies the image to use and other desired deployment options, and use the kubectl command-line tool to create the deployment based on the YAML file.
Option A is incorrect because kubectl app deploy is not a valid command.
Option B is incorrect because gcloud app deploy is used to deploy applications to App Engine, not Kubernetes Engine.
Option D is incorrect because it involves storing the image in Cloud Storage rather than Container Registry.

Correct Answers is (B):
On-demand pricing
Under on-demand pricing, BigQuery charges for queries by using one metric: the number of bytes processed (also referred to as bytes read). You are charged for the number of bytes processed whether the data is stored in BigQuery or in an external data source such as Cloud Storage, Drive, or Cloud Bigtable. On-demand pricing is based solely on usage.

This option is the most accurate way to estimate the cost of your query, because it takes into account the actual number of bytes that will be processed by BigQuery.
Here is an example of how to run a dry run query in BigQuery:
bq dry run --query "SELECT * FROM <dataset>.<table> WHERE <condition>"
This command will print the estimated number of bytes that will be processed by BigQuery. You can then use the Pricing Calculator to convert this bytes estimate to dollars.
Once you have estimated the cost of your query, you can decide whether or not to proceed with running it. If you decide to proceed, you can monitor the cost of your query using the BigQuery Monitoring Console.

A managed instance group (MIG) with autoscaling is the most operationally efficient way to scale virtual machine instances directly based on CPU usage. The instance template defines the VM configuration, and the autoscaling feature ensures that the application scales quickly and efficiently based on resource utilization, meeting the organization's requirements. Kubernetes and third-party tools are unnecessary for this scenario, and scaling based on time is less dynamic and not tied to actual usage.

The correct answer is B.
This option is the most efficient way to scale your application based on CPU usage, because it uses Google Cloud's built-in autoscaling capabilities. Autoscaling allows you to specify a minimum and maximum number of instances, and Google Cloud will automatically add or remove instances as needed to maintain your desired CPU utilization.
Options A, C, and D are not as efficient, because they require more manual intervention to scale your application.
Here are the steps to create a managed instance group with autoscaling configured:
1. Create an instance template.
2. Create a managed instance group from the instance template.
3. Configure autoscaling for the managed instance group.
Once you have configured autoscaling, the managed instance group will automatically add or remove instances as needed to maintain your desired CPU utilization.

Solving this by first eliminating the options that don't suit us. By breaking down the question into the key requirements-
1. Analyzing Google Cloud Platform service costs from three separate projects.
2. Using standard query syntax. -> (Relational data and SQL)
A. 'Cloud Storage bucket'........'Cloud Bigtable'. Not feasible, mainly because cloud BigTable is not good for Structured Data (or Relational Data on which we can run SQL queries as per the question's requirements). BigTable is better suited for Semi Structured data and NoSQL data.
B. 'Cloud Storage bucket'.....'Google Sheets'. Not Feasible because there is no use of SQL in this option, which is one of the requirements.
C. Local file, external tools... this is automatically eliminated because the operation we need is simple, and there has to be a GCP native solution for this. We shouldn't need to rely on going out of the cloud for such a simple thing.

BigQuery is a fully-managed, petabyte-scale analytics data warehouse that enables businesses to analyze all their data very quickly. It is also a good choice for analyzing cost data because it can handle large amounts of data and can perform complex queries quickly.
Time window-based SQL queries allow you to analyze data over a specific time period. For example, you could write a query to calculate the total cost of a particular service for each day of the month.
Here is an example of a BigQuery query that you could use to calculate the total cost of a particular service for each day of the month:
sql
SELECT
cost,
DATE(usage_start_time) AS date
FROM
`[PROJECT_ID].billing.dataset`
WHERE
service_id = 'YOUR_SERVICE_ID'
GROUP BY
date
ORDER BY
date
This query will return a table with two columns: `cost` and `date`. The `cost` column will contain the total cost of the service for each day of the month. The `date` column will contain the date for each row.

Cloud Storage Object Lifecycle Management allows you to define conditions and actions for objects based on their age, creation time, or other attributes.
To meet the requirements:
Move to Coldline after 90 days: This is achieved by setting a SetStorageClass action with an Age condition of 90 days.
Delete after 1 year (365 days): Since the object would have been moved to Coldline after 90 days, the remaining time for deletion is 365 - 90 = 275 days. Set a Delete action with an Age condition of 275 days.

A is not correct. age is defined based on creation time. SetStorageClass only affects the modification time, not the creation time. So the 90 days are not relevant for the deletion rule.

Selected Answer: B
La gestión del ciclo de vida de objetos en Google Cloud Storage permite automatizar el cambio de la clase de almacenamiento y la eliminación de los objetos en función de su antigüedad. Para este caso:
Después de 90 días, se debe cambiar la clase de almacenamiento a Coldline, lo que se hace usando la acción SetStorageClass.
Luego, después de 365 días (1 año), los objetos deben ser eliminados usando la acción Delete.
A es incorrecta porque sugiere eliminar los objetos a los 275 días, lo cual no coincide con el requisito de eliminar los videos después de un año.
C y D son incorrectas porque gsutil rewrite no es la herramienta correcta para gestionar políticas de ciclo de vida.

option A can be misguiding but you don't have to specify 275 days since the rule would be implemented based on the creation of object not after the effect of the previous rule. Hence option B

Pergunta:
You have a Linux VM that must connect to Cloud SQL. You created a service account with the appropriate access rights. You want to make sure that the VM uses this service account instead of the default Compute Engine service account. What should you do?

Alternativas:
- A. When creating the VM via the web console, specify the service account under the 'Identity and API Access' section.
- B. Download a JSON Private Key for the service account. On the Project Metadata, add that JSON as the value for the key compute-engine-service- account.
- C. Download a JSON Private Key for the service account. On the Custom Metadata of the VM, add that JSON as the value for the key compute-engine- service-account.
- D. Download a JSON Private Key for the service account. After creating the VM, ssh into the VM and save the JSON under ~/.gcloud/compute-engine-service- account.json.

Resposta correta:
A. When creating the VM via the web console, specify the service account under the 'Identity and API Access' section.

Changing the service account and access scopes for an instance
If you want to run the VM as a different identity, or you determine that the instance needs a different set of scopes to call the required APIs, you can change the service account and the access scopes of an existing instance. For example, you can change access scopes to grant access to a new API, or change an instance so that it runs as a service account that you created, instead of the Compute Engine default service account. However, Google recommends that you use the fine-grained IAM policies instead of relying on access scopes to control resource access for the service account.
To change an instance's service account and access scopes, the instance must be temporarily stopped. To stop your instance, read the documentation for Stopping an instance. After changing the service account or access scopes, remember to restart the instance. Use one of the following methods to the change service account or access scopes of the stopped instance.
Hope this helps :)

Either the question or the answers are wrong. The question says that we HAVE a Linux VM, so we should strike all the answers that include "when creating the VM.." - on the other hand, adding JSON Tokens to VM metadata is terrible because it's readable in clear-text for everyone. So, what do we need to do here?

The correct way to assign a specific service account to a VM is by specifying it during VM creation in the 'Identity and API Access' section. This ensures the VM uses the specified service account for authentication when accessing Google Cloud services. The other options, which involve manually downloading and managing JSON keys, are not recommended due to security risks and Google's best practices for managing service accounts.

seems like A. doesn't fit. As it's ONLY valid only during the VM creation process. It allows you to assign a custom service account instead of the default one.
However, if the VM is already created, you cannot use this method.

Selected Answer: C
Recommended approach: Download a JSON Private Key for the service account. On the Custom Metadata of the VM, add that JSON as the value for the key compute-service-account.
This will allow the VM to use the specified service account for accessing Cloud SQL, without relying on the default Compute Engine service account.
The other options are not suitable:
Option A is for specifying a service account when creating a VM via the web console, but it's not applicable for an existing VM.
Option B is incorrect, as the compute-engine-service-account key is not a valid key for storing a service account JSON key file.
Option D is not the correct approach, as saving the JSON key file to ~/.gcloud/compute-engine-service-account.json is not a standard way to configure the service account for a VM.

Para asegurarse de que la máquina virtual utilice una cuenta de servicio específica en lugar de la predeterminada de Compute Engine, debes especificar la cuenta de servicio correcta al crear la máquina virtual. En la sección "Identidad y acceso a API", puedes seleccionar la cuenta de servicio adecuada para garantizar que las solicitudes y accesos a otros servicios, como Cloud SQL, se realicen usando los permisos asociados a esa cuenta de servicio.
B, C y D implican el uso de claves privadas JSON, lo cual no es una práctica recomendada debido a los riesgos de seguridad asociados al manejo de claves manualmente.

The question implies that a Linux VM already exists and needs to be configured to use a specific service account instead of the default Compute Engine service account. This is crucial because it eliminates option A, which focuses on setting the service account during VM creation.
Why Option C is Correct:
Custom Metadata : Custom metadata is designed for VM-specific configuration. It's the ideal place to store service account credentials.
compute-engine-service-account : This is the specific metadata key used to tell the VM which service account to use.
JSON Private Key : This is the standard format for storing service account credentials.

I disagree. The Q says that you have just created this VM, which means the FW rules for RDP has also been created. I believe the documentations says it a bit wonky as it is something to check if things aren't working after you've done everything right, as someone could have deleted that rule if this server has been up for a while, rather than having to check this right after you've made a new VM.
I'd say B is better answer than D.

D. Set a Windows username and password in the GCP Console. Verify that a firewall rule for port 3389 exists. Click the RDP button in the GCP Console, and supply the credentials to log in.
Explanation: For connecting to a SQL Server 2017 instance on Google Cloud Compute Engine using the fewest steps, you can use the RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connection, which is supported by default for Windows instances. The steps involved include:
Setting a Windows username and password: You need to specify these credentials in the GCP Console to access the instance via RDP.
Verifying the firewall rule for port 3389: Port 3389 is the default RDP port, so you need to ensure the appropriate firewall rule is in place.
Clicking the RDP button in the GCP Console: Once these settings are configured, you can use the RDP button in the console to connect to the instance. You'll then supply the credentials you set in the console.
