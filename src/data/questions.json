Deployment Manager is a configuration management tool that allows you to define and deploy a set of resources, including Compute Engine VMs, in a declarative manner. You can use it to specify the exact specifications of your VMs in a configuration file, and Deployment Manager will create and manage those VMs for you. Deployment Manager is recommended by Google as a way to automate and manage the deployment of resources on the Google Cloud Platform.\nhttps://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/ jogoldberg 4 months, 2 weeks ago\nThe correct answer (Infrastructure Manager) is missing.\nDeployment Manager USED to be the correct answer, however Deployment Manager goes End of Life on 31-Dec-2025, and will be fully deprecated on 31-Mar-2026."

        "text": "Anonymous: Buruguduystunstugudunstuy Highly Voted 3 years ago\nSelected Answer: C\nThe correct answer is Option C. To deploy a Docker container on Kubernetes Engine, you should first create a Docker image from the Dockerfile and push it to Container Registry, which is a fully-managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for you to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. Then, you can create a Deployment YAML file that specifies the image to use and other desired deployment options, and use the kubectl command-line tool to create the deployment based on the YAML file.\nOption A is incorrect because kubectl app deploy is not a valid command.\nOption B is incorrect because gcloud app deploy is used to deploy applications to App Engine, not Kubernetes Engine.\nOption D is incorrect because it involves storing the image in Cloud Storage rather than Container Registry.\nhttps://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/deploying-a-container ast3citos 2 years, 11 months ago\nThe link you provided has stopped working :_( jogoldberg 4 months, 2 weeks ago\nContainer Registry is deprecated.

It is also a good choice for analyzing cost data because it can handle large amounts of data and can perform complex queries quickly.\nTime window-based SQL queries allow you to analyze data over a specific time period. For example, you could write a query to calculate the total cost of a particular service for each day of the month.\nHere is an example of a BigQuery query that you could use to calculate the total cost of a particular service for each day of the month:\nsql\nSELECT\ncost,\nDATE(usage_start_time) AS date\nFROM\n`[PROJECT_ID].billing.dataset`\nWHERE\nservice_id = 'YOUR_SERVICE_ID'\nGROUP BY\ndate\nORDER BY\ndate\nThis query will return a table with two columns: `cost` and `date`. The `cost` column will contain the total cost of the service for each day of the month. The `date` column will contain the date for each row."

For example, you can change access scopes to grant access to a new API, or change an instance so that it runs as a service account that you created, instead of the Compute Engine default service account. However, Google recommends that you use the fine-grained IAM policies instead of relying on access scopes to control resource access for the service account.\nTo change an instance's service account and access scopes, the instance must be temporarily stopped. To stop your instance, read the documentation for Stopping an instance. After changing the service account or access scopes, remember to restart the instance. Use one of the following methods to the change service account or access scopes of the stopped instance.\nHope this helps :)"

It is easier to add members to and remove members from a Google group instead of updating an IAM policy to add or remove users.\n❑ If you need to grant multiple roles to allow a particular task, create a Google group, grant the roles to that group, and then add users to that group.\nhttps://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/using-iam-securely#policy_management JackGlemins 4 years, 11 months ago\nOther best practice is use predefine roles over custom roles.

It consists of two log streams for each project: Admin Activity and Data Access.\nAdmin Activity logs contain log entries for API calls or other administrative actions that modify the configuration or metadata of resources. Admin Activity logs are always enabled. There is no charge for your Admin Activity audit logs.\nData Access logs record API calls that create, modify, or read user-provided data. Data Access audit logs are disabled by default because they can be large.\nlogging.viewer: The logging.viewer role gives the security admin team the ability to view the Admin Activity logs.\nlogging.privateLogViewer : The logging.privateLogViewer role gives the ability to view the Data Access logs. ESP_SAP 4 years, 10 months ago\nCorrect Answer is (B): (Continuation).\nScenario: External auditors\nIn this scenario, audit logs for an organization are aggregated and exported to a central sink location. A third-party auditor is granted access several\ntimes a year to review the organization's audit logs. The auditor is not authorized to view PII data in the Admin Activity logs.\nDuring normal access, the auditors' Google group is only granted access to view the historic logs stored in BigQuery. If any anomalies are discovered,\nthe group is granted permission to view the actual Cloud Logging Admin Activity logs via the dashboard's elevated access mode. At the end of each audit period,\nthe group's access is then revoked.\nData is redacted using Cloud DLP before being made accessible for viewing via the dashboard application. ESP_SAP 4 years, 10 months ago\nCorrect Answer is (B): (Continuation).\nThe table below explains IAM logging roles that an Organization Administrator can grant to the service account used by the dashboard,\nas well as the resource level at which the role is granted:\nlogging.viewer Organization Dashboard service account The logging.viewer role permits the service account to read the Admin Activity logs in Cloud Logging.\nbigquery.dataViewer BigQuery dataset Dashboard service account The bigquery.dataViewer role permits the service account used by the dashboard application\nto read the exported Admin Activity logs."

In such cases, setting a partition expiration is often more appropriate because it ensures that you're continuously retaining a rolling window of log data (for example, the last 60 days' worth) and automatically purging older data, rather than deleting the entire table at once after a certain period. Cynthia2023 1 year, 6 months ago\nIn BigQuery, setting an expiration time for tables can be applied in two contexts:\nTable Expiration:\nWhen you set a table expiration time at the table level, it applies to the entire table. This means that the entire table will be deleted once the specified expiration time has elapsed since the table's creation time.\nPartition Expiration:\nFor partitioned tables, you can set a partition expiration time, which applies to individual partitions within the table. Each partition's data will be deleted once the specified expiration time has elapsed since the creation of that specific partition.\nThis is particularly useful for time-series data, like logs, where you might want to only keep recent data and allow older data to be automatically purged."

However, they are not intended for long-term storage and may not provide the same level of durability as persistent disks. Since the application is primarily reading large files from disk and experiencing disk read throttling, using a Local SSD should provide a significant improvement in performance while minimizing costs. Increasing the size of the Zonal SSD Persistent Disk or increasing the allocated CPU to the instance may provide some improvement, but are unlikely to fully address the disk read throttling issue.

In practice, this means you should configure service accounts for your instances with the following process:\nCreate a new service account rather than using the Compute Engine default service account.\nGrant IAM roles to that service account for only the resources that it needs.\nConfigure the instance to run as that service account.\nGrant the instance the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform scope to allow full access to all Google Cloud APIs, so that the IAM permissions of the instance are completely determined by the IAM roles of the service account.\nAvoid granting more access than necessary and regularly check your service account permissions to make sure they are up-to-date.\nhttps://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances#best_practices Ridhanya 4 years, 1 month ago\nyou just gave justification for option A which is right ryumada 3 years, 5 months ago\nYou should read lxgywil comment.

The principle of least privilege is a core tenet, and custom service accounts embody this. Option B aligns precisely with the best practice for production environments and demonstrates a clear understanding of IAM concepts. While Option A could be acceptable with careful permission adjustments, exams often favor the solution most demonstrably secure and aligned with recommended practice out of the box.\nI believe option A might be a trap.

Enable API, create a workspace under project A, and then add projects B and C.\nTo monitor multiple Google Cloud projects in a single pane of glass, you can use Google Cloud's operations suite, formerly known as Stackdriver. By enabling the Cloud Monitoring API and creating a workspace under project A, you can add projects B and C to the same workspace. This will allow you to view metrics for CPU, memory, and disk usage for all projects in the same workspace. You can also set up alerting policies to be notified of any potential issues across all projects.\nEnabling the API alone or giving metrics.reader role to the projects will not provide a single pane of glass view of all the projects.

You can read and write files to Cloud Storage buckets from almost anywhere, so you can use buckets as common storage between your instances, App Engine, your on-premises systems, and other cloud services.\nhttps://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/gcs-buckets\nWhy not (B)?\nCaution\nCloud Source Repositories are intended to store only the source code for your app and not user or personal data. Don't store any Core App Engine Customer Data (as defined in your License Agreement) in Cloud Source Repositories.\nhttps://cloud.google.com/source-repositories/docs/features stepkurniawan 5 years, 4 months ago\nyou store the sensitive data NOT in the instance template, that is the current best practice. But you need version control like GIT or Google's GIT (Cloud Source Repo) to backup your code somehow and able to roll back if needed. JohnnieWalker 4 years, 6 months ago\nB is the answer. Deployment Manager Template can be written in either Jinja or Python, this is Infrastructure as Code (IaC) we are talking about here, same as AWS Cloudformation, or Terraform. Therefore, they should be stored on a git repository such as Google Cloud Source Repositories. magistrum 5 years ago\nLook at my post above, cloud repo is for code, not templates gcpengineer 4 years, 5 months ago\nB is the ans pYWORLD 4 years, 5 months ago\nI agree with what are you saying, but the problem that you know how the deployment manager template looks?

To restrict egress traffic effectively, you need to explicitly set up firewall rules.\nBlocking All Egress Traffic: The low-priority rule (priority 65534, near the lowest priority) should be configured to block all egress traffic. This creates a baseline rule that denies all egress traffic by default.\nAllowing Specific Ports: The high-priority rule (priority 1000, indicating a higher priority) should be set to allow egress traffic only on the specific ports that are required for the application.

AE is a traditional hosting platform: it runs continuously and serves requests as they come in. At the end of the month, you pay for the amount of time it was running, which is typically “the entire month”.\nCloud Run runs containers, so for each release you have to build a container and push it to GCP.

Provision Compute Engine instances with local SSDs attached.\nThe best option for an ERP system that holds the full database in-memory for fast data access is to provision Compute Engine instances with local SSDs attached. Local SSDs offer high input/output operations per second (IOPS) and low latency, which can significantly improve the performance of in-memory databases. Preemptible Compute Engine instances are designed for short-lived and fault-tolerant workloads and are not recommended for a critical system like an ERP.

This is accurately addressed by option A (Deploy the application on GKE, and add a HorizontalPodAutoscaler to the deployment).\nHowever, it's also important to have node autoscaling enabled (as mentioned in option C) to ensure that the cluster can accommodate the scaling pods. Both pod and node scaling are important for a fully scalable solution, but the immediate focus when deploying a new application is typically on pod configuration and scaling. PiperMe 1 year, 10 months ago\nThis is incorrect. Horizontal Pod Autoscalers scale based on pod-level metrics such as CPU. While useful, HPAs don't directly address the need to add more nodes if the underlying infrastructure is at capacity. The answer is C which provides the most effective and streamlined way to achieve automatic cluster-level scaling in a GKE environment hosting multiple microservices."

Horizontal Pod autoscaling helps to ensure that your workload functions consistently in different situations, and allows you to control costs by only paying for extra capacity when you need it."

It exchanges network topology information through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Cloud Router advertises subnets from its VPC network to another router or gateway via BGP. This is great for setting up VPN between the cloud and on-prem, as topology changes automatically propagate with no manual intervention and higher redundancy for your systems.\nYou now have:\nDiscovery of remote networks\nMaintaining up-to-date routing information\nChoosing the best path to destination networks\nAbility to find a new best path if the current path is no longer available\nAnd a great side effect can be lower latency because Cloud Router learns routes through BGP which allows for optimal data paths to reach its destination, whether that be another network or a VPN gateway to on-premise. Cloud Router is also how Dedicated Interconnect can give you 10 gbp/s bandwidth between your cloud VPC and your peered on-premise data center."

According to Best Practices in this Google Doc (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances#best_practices) you grant the instance the scope and the permissions are determined by the IAM roles of the service account. In this case, you would grant the instance the scope and the role (storage.objectCreator) to the service account.\nAns B and C\nRole from GCP Console:\nID = roles/storage.objectCreator\nRole launch stage = General Availability\nDescription = Access to create objects in GCS.\n3 assigned permissions\nresourcemanager.projects.get\nresourcemanager.projects.list\nstorage.objects.create nickyshil 3 years, 5 months ago\nThere are many access scopes available to choose from, but a best practice is to set the cloud-platform access scope, which is an OAuth scope for most Google Cloud services, and then control the service account's access by granting it IAM roles..you have an app that reads and writes files on Cloud Storage, it must first authenticate to the Cloud Storage API. You can create an instance with the cloud-platform scope and attach a service account to the instance\nhttps://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts ryumada 3 years, 5 months ago\nReading the second point of the best practice. You should grant your VM the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform scope to allow access to most of Google Cloud APIs.\nSo, that the IAM permissions are completely determined by the IAM roles you granted to the service account.\nThe conclusion is you should not mess up with the VM scopes to grant access to Google Services, instead you should grant the access via IAM roles of the service account you attached to the VM.\nhttps://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances#best_practices"

If you prefer simplicity and broader categorization, network tags may be a suitable choice. carlalap 2 years, 2 months ago\nAlthough what was previously stated is correct, I must correct it. The correct answer would be option A. Creating an ingress firewall rule on the subnet where your database servers are located is the appropriate approach. This rule would control incoming traffic to the database servers, ensuring that only traffic from the specified application servers (identified by network tags or service accounts) is allowed."

It allows you to centralize billing and payment management while providing flexibility to project creators.

It allows you to migrate your existing application as-is to the Google Cloud platform.\n->Instance Scheduling: You can schedule the VM instance to start and stop at specific times, such as midnight, to align with your existing processing schedule. This ensures that the application runs at the required time, similar to the on-premises setup.\n->Minimal Effort and Cost: The \"lift and shift\" approach minimizes the need for code modifications or containerization, reducing migration complexity. It also allows you to use the same binaries and configurations as your on-premises setup, saving development effort. You only pay for the VM's compute resources when it's running, making it cost-effective."

Environment variables are a common way to securely pass sensitive information like credentials.\n- No Logging of Credentials: The gcloud CLI typically does not log environment variables, so your credentials should be safe from being recorded in the CLI logs.\n- Ease of Use: Setting environment variables is straightforward and does not require modifying configuration files or encoding credentials. Cynthia2023 2 years ago\nA. Using gcloud config set for Username and Password: This approach directly enters the credentials into the gcloud CLI configuration, which could potentially be logged or exposed in the configuration file.\nB. Encoding Credentials and Custom CA Certs File: This option suggests a method that isn't directly related to setting proxy credentials. The core/custom_ca_certs_file is used for specifying a custom CA (Certificate Authority) certificate file, not for proxy credentials.\nC. Using the Configuration File: Modifying the configuration file to include proxy credentials might expose them in plain text within the file, which could be a security risk. It's generally safer to use environment variables for this purpose."

Managing SSL certificates on the load balancer simplifies certificate management, especially in an autoscaling environment where new instances are frequently created and removed. yomi95 1 year, 3 months ago\nOption A: preferred.\nUses an external HTTP(S) load balancer with a managed SSL certificate.

This ensures that pods have enough resources to run efficiently without being over-provisioned, which can lead to wasted resources and higher costs.\nAutomated Optimization: VPA continuously monitors the resource usage of your pods and recommends optimal settings. You can choose to apply these recommendations automatically or manually, giving you flexibility and control over the process.\nMicroservice-Specific Tuning: By configuring a VPA for each microservice, you can fine-tune the resource allocation for each individual service based on its specific needs and usage patterns.

When a new request arrives, a new instance is spun up, leading to a cold start. During this cold start, multiple API calls might be made to initialize the application and connect to the Cloud SQL database. If there's a sudden spike in traffic, a large number of cold starts can occur simultaneously, exceeding the Cloud SQL API quota.\nMinimum Instances: By setting a minimum number of Cloud Run instances, you can ensure that a few instances are always running, even during periods of low traffic.

Once the API is enabled, the service account can be used to authenticate the App Engine application to the Cloud Pub/Sub API.\nAnswer B is incorrect because there is no automatic enablement of APIs when a service account accesses them.

For example, you can attach a service account to a Compute Engine instance so that applications running on that instance can authenticate as the service account. Then, you can grant the service account IAM roles to let the service account—and, by extension, applications on the instance—access Google Cloud resources."

Google recommends using an HTTP(S) load balancer for terminating SSL sessions and load-balancing traffic to an instance group serving a public web application over HTTPS.\nAnswer B is incorrect because it is an internal load balancer, which is not suitable for serving public web applications. Internal load balancers are used for private/internal applications.\nAnswer C is incorrect because SSL proxy load balancers do not terminate the SSL session, instead they pass the SSL traffic directly to the backends without decrypting it. SSL proxy load balancers are used when you need to ensure that SSL is used end-to-end between the client and the backend, and when you want to offload SSL processing from the backends.\nAnswer D is incorrect because TCP proxy load balancers do not terminate SSL sessions. TCP proxy load balancers are used for non-HTTP traffic and can balance traffic at the TCP layer, but they do not have the ability to terminate SSL sessions. chikorita 2 years, 9 months ago\nyo never fail us, my lord!"

When adding new instances, it is important to ensure that only the necessary number of instances are added to the instance group and that the group size is properly maintained to prevent overprovisioning and unnecessary costs.\nIn this scenario, the instance group is adding more instances than necessary when autoscaling due to the initial delay of HTTP health checks. Increasing the initial delay to 200 seconds will ensure that the health check properly reflects the actual availability of the instances and prevent overprovisioning.\nAnswers A and B limit the maximum number of instances, which could cause issues when scaling to support higher levels of end-user traffic.\nAnswer C suggests using a TCP health check instead of an HTTP health check, but it does not address the issue of overprovisioning when autoscaling."

Use preemptible VM instances of the appropriate standard machine type.\nPreemptible VM instances offer the lowest cost for batch processing jobs in the Google Cloud Platform. Preemptible VM instances are computed instances that can run for a maximum of 24 hours and provide no availability guarantees. Preemptible VM instances are up to 80% cheaper than standard compute instances, making them an excellent choice for batch-processing workloads that can be interrupted.\nThe small instance type in a single-node cluster (ANSWER A) would not provide enough resources for batch processing jobs, and the micro instance types in a three-node cluster (ANSWER B) may not provide enough resources for the batch processing jobs to complete within the allotted time. VM instance types that support micro-bursting (ANSWER D) may not provide enough sustained CPU performance to complete batch processing jobs within the desired time frame."

On the App Engine Versions page of the GCP Console, route 100% of the traffic to the previous version.\nTo immediately revert to the prior version of an application in App Engine, you can route 100% of the traffic to the previous version. This can be done through the App Engine Versions page of the GCP Console by selecting the desired version and selecting \"Migrate traffic\" and moving the slider to 100%. This will ensure that all traffic is directed to the prior version until the bug is fixed and the new version can be safely redeployed.\nhttps://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/migrating-traffic\nANSWER A (Run gcloud app restore) and ANSWER B (Click Revert on GCP Console) are not valid actions to revert to the prior version of the application.

Cloud CDN is a content delivery network that caches content at edge locations around the world to reduce latency and improve website performance.\nANSWER B, enabling \"Share publicly\" on the PDF file objects, only controls whether or not the files are accessible to users without authentication. It does not affect how the files are displayed in the browser.\nANSWER D, adding a label to the storage bucket with a key of Content-Type and value of application/pdf, is not the correct way to set the Content-Type metadata for individual objects. Labels are used for organizing resources, while metadata is used to provide information about the data itself.\nTherefore, ANSWER C, setting Content-Type metadata to application/pdf on the PDF file objects, is the correct answer. dnur 2 years, 4 months ago\nMany thanks for clear explanations! :)"

Instead, you must change the VM's machine type to one with the desired memory and vCPU configuration (e.g., n1-standard-8, which has 8 GB of memory). The VM needs to be stopped before making this change, and then it can be restarted.\nWhy not other options?\nA (Live migration): Live migration moves workloads during maintenance but does not change the VM's memory allocation.\nB (Metadata change): Adding metadata does not affect memory allocation.\nD (Directly increasing memory): You cannot manually increase only the memory of a VM; you must select a predefined machine type."

Then, you can increase the memory of the VM by editing the machine type and selecting a machine type with more memory. Once you have made the change, you can start the VM again.\nANSWER A is not the best approach as it relies on live migration which can be a risky operation.\nANSWER B is incorrect because adding metadata to the VM will not change the amount of memory allocated to the VM.\nANSWER C is incorrect because changing the machine type to n1-standard-8 would also increase the number of vCPUs to 8, which may not be necessary and could result in overprovisioning of resources. In addition, changing the machine type would also affect the cost of the VM instance, which may not be desired. Since the primary concern in this scenario is to increase memory."

Since only port 8080 is required, we eliminate the options that open all ports. That leaves two choices: one using ingress and one using egress. Since egress traffic is allowed by default and ingress is not, the correct answer must be the ingress rule. Therefore, option B is the only valid choice. Upvoted 101 times."

The first rule allows Tier 1 to communicate with Tier 2, and the second allows Tier 2 to communicate with Tier 3. This ensures only the correct instances can communicate.

In this case, we want to send 1% of traffic to the new test version and keep the remaining 99% on the current version. This can be achieved by deploying the new version in the same application and using the `--splits` option to give a weight of 99 to the current version and a weight of 1 to the new version.\nAnswer A is incorrect because the `--migrate` option is used for migrating traffic to a new version after it has been fully tested and is ready for full deployment.\nAnswer C is incorrect because it requires additional configuration to proxy requests to the new version, increasing complexity unnecessarily.\nAnswer D is incorrect because it involves configuring a network load balancer, which is not necessary for this use case and adds unnecessary complexity.

By setting `maxSurge` to 1, the new version of the application can be gradually rolled out while maintaining the same number of available instances.\nThe `maxUnavailable` parameter controls the maximum number of instances that can be unavailable during the update process. By setting `maxUnavailable` to 0, at least one instance of the previous version will be available at all times, ensuring that there is no decrease in available capacity during the deployment.\nBy performing a rolling update with `maxSurge` set to 1 and `maxUnavailable` set to 0, the new version of the application can be gradually deployed with zero downtime and no decrease in available capacity. Buruguduystunstugudunstuy 2 years, 5 months ago\nAnswer A is incorrect because setting maxSurge to 0 means that no additional instances are created beyond the existing number of instances in the group, which can potentially lead to a decrease in capacity. Also, setting maxUnavailable to 1 means that one instance can be unavailable at any given time, which can potentially lead to some users experiencing downtime.\nAnswer C is incorrect because creating a new managed instance group would require adding the new group to the backend service, which can take time and potentially cause downtime. Also, deleting the old managed instance group before ensuring that the new group is healthy can cause a decrease in capacity.\nAnswer D is incorrect because deleting instances in the managed instance group can cause a temporary decrease in capacity, and it may take some time for new instances to be created with the new instance template. Also, the new instances may take time to warm up, which can cause a delay in serving traffic."

Cloud Spanner is a fully managed, scalable, relational database that is designed to handle global deployments with ease. It can handle large amounts of data and high transactional volumes. It also provides automatic sharding and synchronous replication, ensuring high availability and durability of data. Cloud Spanner supports SQL semantics and provides a familiar relational database experience to developers, which would make it easy to adopt in existing workflows.\nCloud SQL, on the other hand, has limits on scalability and does not support global deployments as well as Cloud Spanner.\nCloud Firestore and Cloud Datastore are NoSQL databases that are better suited for document-based data storage and not optimized for relational data storage."

From simple caching use cases to real time analytics, Memorystore for Redis provides the performance you need.\nCaching: Cache is an integral part of modern application architectures. Memorystore for Redis provides low latency access and high throughput for heavily accessed data, compared to accessing the data from a disk based backend store. Session management, frequently accessed queries, scripts, and pages are common examples of caching.\nhttps://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/redis-overview#what_its_good_for"

In that case, selecting local SSD and adding an estimated cost for cluster management, as suggested in Answer B, would be sufficient.\nHowever, it is important to note that the cost estimate may not be accurate if any of the details in the GCP pricing calculator are incorrect or do not match your requirements. Therefore, it is always a good practice to review all the details and ensure that they are accurate and up to date before finalizing the cost estimate.\nIn summary, if persistent disk storage and snapshot storage are already populated, and you only require local SSD and an estimated cost for cluster management, then Answer B is a valid choice. Still, I go with Answer A my friend. :)"

It's one of the several types of Services available in Kubernetes to control how external sources can access services running within the cluster. Here's what a NodePort service entails:\nExposing Services Outside the Cluster:\nA NodePort service makes your application accessible from outside the Kubernetes cluster by opening a specific port (the NodePort) on all the nodes (VMs) in your cluster. This port is randomly selected from a defined range (default: 30000-32767) unless you specify a particular port. Cynthia2023 2 years ago\nWhen a NodePort service is created, each node in the cluster allocates the specified NodePort. External traffic can access the service by hitting any node's IP address at the NodePort, regardless of whether that node is actually running a pod for the service.\nKubernetes internally routes that traffic to the appropriate pods, even if they are running on different nodes."

Grant them the required IAM roles using their G Suite email address.\nTo grant G Suite users access to a Cloud Platform project, you should use their G Suite email addresses to grant them the required IAM roles.\nAnswer A is incorrect because enabling Cloud Identity is not necessary for granting G Suite users access to a Cloud Platform project. Cloud Identity provides a centralized identity management system for G Suite and Cloud Platform, but it is not required for this use case.\nAnswer C is incorrect because there is no need to convert G Suite email addresses into Google Cloud Platform accounts. G Suite users already have Google accounts and can be granted access to Cloud Platform using their G Suite email addresses.\nAnswer D is incorrect because there is no default behavior in the Cloud Platform to grant access to users who are members of a particular group.

It has a minimum storage duration of 30 days, which makes it suitable for archiving data that needs to be kept for a long time but is accessed infrequently. Additionally, Nearline Storage has lower storage costs than Coldline Storage, making it more cost-effective for this use case.\nBy adding a bucket lifecycle rule that archives data with newer versions after 30 days to Nearline Storage, you can ensure that the data is automatically moved to a more cost-effective storage class while still being easily accessible for reporting purposes. dnur 2 years, 3 months ago\nYou're incorrect.

The correct answer is B Linus11 4 years, 8 months ago\nThe real crux of this question is the mention about \"Pre-emptible Node pool\". That need to take into consider while determining the answer. If we choose B, then the importance of \"Pre-emptible node pool\" is not there. Whether the node pool is pre-emptible or not, resource scarcity can lead to pending pods.\nWhen we consider the mention of \"Pre-emptible Node Poll\" , then the answer is obviously D. if a pre-meptible Node get pre-empted there will be a delay in cluster to sync it.\nAnswer is D. alexgrig 4 years, 3 months ago\nQuestions says \"Single Node\" at that case the second pod can't be in running state. brvinod 3 years, 11 months ago\nA node can have multiple pods. So that is not a problem. MidhunJose 3 years, 12 months ago\nIt says a single node pool, not a single node. Meaning there can be multiple nodes, right? brvinod 3 years, 11 months ago\nPre-emptible would have been an issue if the cluster had more than one node. The question clearly states that it is a single node cluster. That means if that single VM was pre-empted, neither of the pods should have been running. Since one pod is running, that means that (the only) VM is running. So, the reason the second pod is still pending because the VM is not having enough resources to run both the pods. Hence B. mplibunao 3 years, 7 months ago\nActually the question stated \"single preemptible node pool\" and not \"single node\" so it's possible that there are multiple nodes and one of the node on which the pod was scheduled on was preempted Finger41 4 years, 7 months ago\nThis is to throw you off, when there is insufficient resources for a Pod to stand up, then the status will equal pending : https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-application/#:~:text=If%20a%20Pod%20is%20stuck,be%20scheduled%20onto%20a%20node.&text=You%20don't%20have%20enough,new%20nodes%20to%20your%20cluster.

It's particularly useful in scenarios where containers might be running untrusted or arbitrary code, as it helps in mitigating the risk of kernel exploits.\nBy configuring a node pool with gVisor and specifying runtimeClassName: gvisor in the Pod specifications, each Pod is run within this sandboxed environment, thereby enhancing isolation between the Pods. Cynthia2023 1 year, 6 months ago\nA. Binary Authorization: While Binary Authorization is a security control that ensures only trusted container images are deployed on GKE, it doesn't provide isolation between running Pods. It's more about image integrity and compliance.\nB. Container Analysis API: This API is used for scanning container images for vulnerabilities. While important for security, it doesn't directly contribute to runtime isolation between Pods.\nD. Using cos_containerd Image: The Container-Optimized OS with containerd (cos_containerd) is a secure choice for the node image in GKE. However, it doesn't provide the same level of isolation for arbitrary code execution in Pods as gVisor. The nodeSelector parameter is used to schedule Pods on specific nodes but doesn't enhance inter-Pod isolation. Cynthia2023 1 year, 6 months ago\n• Implementing gVisor can impact the performance of the containers due to the additional layer of abstraction. However, for scenarios requiring high security and isolation, particularly when running arbitrary code, the trade-off can be justified."

In this case, the sequential nature of the person_id as a primary key can lead to hotspotting because new records are continually added at the \"end\" of the key space, creating a hot node which can cause performance bottlenecks.\n• Monotonically Increasing Values: Monotonically increasing values as primary keys can exacerbate the hotspotting effect because each new entry is placed after the last, creating a write hotspot on the last node that handles the upper bound of the key range. Over time, this can lead to unbalanced read/write loads across the nodes. Cynthia2023 2 years ago\n• Alternatives to Monotonic Keys: To mitigate this, you can use a primary key that distributes writes more evenly across the key space. This could be achieved by using a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) or sharding the monotonically increasing identifier by combining it with another value that has a more random distribution."

By specifying the production project as the destination project, you can copy the IAM roles from the development project to the production project.\nOption B is incorrect because specifying your organization as the destination organization will copy the IAM roles to all projects within the organization, which is not what you want."

        "text": "Anonymous: YourCloudGuru 1 year, 3 months ago\nSelected Answer: A\nThe correct answer is A. Use gcloud iam roles copy and specify the production project as the destination project.\nThe gcloud iam roles copy command copies a role from one project to another. To use this command, you will need to know the name of the role that you want to copy and the name of the destination project.\nFor example, to copy the role roles/compute.instanceAdmin from the project my-dev-project to the project my-prod-project, you would run the following command:\ngcloud iam roles copy roles/compute.instanceAdmin my-dev-project my-prod-project\nThis command will copy the role roles/compute.instanceAdmin to the project my-prod-project. The role will have the same permissions in the production project as it does in the development project."
